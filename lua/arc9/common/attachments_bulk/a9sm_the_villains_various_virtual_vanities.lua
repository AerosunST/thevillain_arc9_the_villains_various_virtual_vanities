ATT.Description = [[Est. 2073. Formed in response to the largest mass resurgence of vampirism since 1993, the Vampire Hunter Society is a joint effort between science and military to both cure the dreaded BioNV-93 necrovirus- the virus that eventually causes vampirism, and run vampirism back into extinction. It is a noble cause, but not everyone is welcoming of their efforts. Many hold the belief that vampires are people much like humans are, meaning that exterminating them would be inhumane. These evolutionists are known as "Sympathy", the antithesis of Vampire Hunter Society's goals. No matter what stands in their way, Vampire Hunter Society stops at nothing to rid the world of vampirism.

This is the Patriam version of the Vampire Hunter Society logo. Patriam is not the name of the story but rather the planet it takes place on. The story is directly adapted upon the original lore from Scarlet Hunter, except now it is fully realized into a proper universe. You may be familiar with the SYNTHESIS Abandonware Pack from ArcCW. Patriam is Scarlet Hunter's spiritual successor, and if you had any interest in the lore of the SYNTHESIS Pack, I strongly suggest checking this out when I am finished writing it.

It is important to note that while they are the direct inspiration, they have no relationship whatsoever. Scarlet Hunter's portrayal of The Void is much more abstract (it's more symbolic if anything) than it is compared to Patriam's version. This logo is here purely for nostalgia.
