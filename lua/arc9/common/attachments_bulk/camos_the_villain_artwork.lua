Despite this camo looking like it would tessellate seemlessly, it does not. This is because when I had created in in 2018, I did not know how to export a pattern directly to photoshop and is unfortunately the result of not understanding illustrator at the time.

This design was then printed onto a new hoodie and replaced it shortly thereafter. I still have this hoodie in my closet and just like the original, it's super comfy.
