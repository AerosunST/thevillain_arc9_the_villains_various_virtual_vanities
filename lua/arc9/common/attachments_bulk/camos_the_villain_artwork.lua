My plan with this design was to replace a beloved hoodie that was unfortunately losing its design from every day wear and tear. Though it was not Purple and Blue like seen here, it was an adaptation I made based on Murvivi Arrowclub... Hence its name.

Despite this camo looking like it would tessellate seemlessly, it does not. This is because when I had created in in 2018, I did not know how to export a pattern directly to photoshop and is unfortunately the result of not understanding illustrator at the time. Instead, it was saved as a reeeaaaallly big (like, 16,000x16,000px) image.]]

It was comfortable and had my favorite colors. I had a huge fascination for all things vampire hunting between 2013-2020 (I still dig it though) so it earned the aforementioned title as being my favorite hoodie. This design was then printed onto a new hoodie and replaced it shortly thereafter. I still have this hoodie in my closet and just like the original, it's super comfy.
